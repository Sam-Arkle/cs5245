Whereas we\u2019ve conceded the third highest number of goals in the top ten teams and twice as many as Sheffield United.<br/>Having said that we\u2019ve got more players back and are a more potent striking force than at the beginning of the season. A match fit Paal and Laird have made us much more difficult to play against.<br/>The question may be how Beale will deal with the almost certain high press and physicality of United. As an indication, they\u2019ve had 27 bookings, the second highest in the league, compared with our 16. \u201c</p><p>\u201cSheffield United have only conceded 1 in 5 games I think, so tomorrow has got 0-0 written all over it, which I\u2019d be delighted with.\u201d</p></blockquote>, <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThink we\u2019d all take a point from this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d take a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take 3 as always. One of the things I do like about Beale is he goes the way we must go, for 3.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we want promotion we really need 3 points to close the gap to the top\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe International break doesn\u2019t seem to have done them any favours. Three away wins before the break and then a home draw against Brum after.<br/>Maybe it will be a good time to go there (alternatively they will be looking for a reaction after expecting to win against Brum).<br/>Should definitely go for the three and see what this team can do against the league leaders.<br/>Be great to see our defence have a solid game against the other top scorers in the Championship.\u201d</p></blockquote>, <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cLots of noise coming outta their camp saying that they are gonna smash us cos they only drew with Brum.<br/>Beale says bring em on !<br/>Love it if we could shut them up !! \u201c</p><p>\u201cI think Sheffield will be taking us very seriously but I think we will win\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the Micky Beale Revolution in full flight, l think this will be water off a ducks back.<br/>Sheff 0 \u2013 QPR 2<br/>Footnote- This post was written with all fingers, legs, toes &amp; arms, crossed. Please don\u2019t ask me to get up &amp; get a coldie from the bar fridge!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe most encouraging part of the Bristol City game for me, was how positive we were. We got the ball forward as quickly as possible and whoever had the ball seemed to have runners giving them options, or creating space for others. It seemed a really positive display. We are certainly going to need to keep that going, and even up the level a bit, as we face tougher opposition on Tuesday night.<br/>Just a final observation. Surely it must go against us that we have travelled to Bristol and back on Saturday, and then head to Sheffield on Tuesday night, whilst they have two home games in a row. I know these things level out over the course of a whole season, but it must cause extra fatigue for our squad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Mick wants to use the squad when matches are coming thick and fast. He has admitted in the past that it was a mistake to field he same team when matches are coming in quick succession.\u201d</p></blockquote>, <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cShame this is coming so soon after the Bristol game, I hope our boys legs aren\u2019t shot from the exertions of that game. We desperately need Paal fit to play and Salter would be handy too. Think Dykes might start this game and possibly Amos too. Gonna be seriously tough and the midfield battle will be key, here\u2019s hoping for another Willock masterclass and Beale has the savvy to turn the whippet breeders over !\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven the quick turnaround from Saturday, I\u2019d be very happy to come away unbeaten.<br/>Not at all convinced we will. \u201c</p><p>\u201cLets give Prince Abdullah a QPR welcome\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully they\u2019re thinking what a decent side we are more than we\u2019re thinking by heck it t\u2019sheffied utd\u2026\u201d.</p><p>\u201cBLADES!!

But the \u2018seven hills just like Rome\u2019 makes me laugh almost as much as \u2018more miles of canal in Brum than Venice\u2019 ( and many more prams and shopping trolleys in them too). \u201c</p></blockquote>]"}

However it seems that when they came up against a well organised defence as against us in the game in Sheffield they didn\u2019t have much of a plan B, which i think made them a bit inconsistent. I thought they were a better side than Bournemouth last year (even though the table said otherwise).<br/>They\u2019ve had a couple of bad results and will want to come out all guns blazing, there is going to be close on 30,000 people there and what i remember the fans are twitchy. They have the second leanest defence so far, but again from what i remember they have a tendency to dick about in their own half, susceptible to the press. Can we be organised defensively from the off and play with the kind of intensity and energy that we played with in the last 25 on Saturday????? \u201c</p></blockquote>, <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThey are one of the better teams but are no doubt going through a sticky patch. We have nothing to lose but must try to stay positive and not sit too deep as we did in the 1st half against Watford. Their fans will probably see us as an easy touch so a good start could see them getting a little twitchy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad time think they\u2019ve lost 2 on the trot can almost be sure they wont lose a third<br/>Be obviously hoping they will\u201d</p><p>\u201cDespite them being quality and most definitely owing us one after last seasons smash and grab I\u2019m quite looking forward to it.<br/>They\u2019re missing a few key players like ourselves so could be a leveller. Genuinely think we\u2019ve played quite well the last three games. Optimistic about picking up a point minimum. How\u2019s ticket sales going? Last season was probably my favourite away game as far as result and atmosphere goes\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Sheffield Utd fan I sometimes walk with texted me this<br/>We\u2019re in an injury crisis with 8 first team defenders and 3 midfielders out before today\u2019s game. Each week injuries have got worse so it\u2019s a makeshift team in place now. You are playing us at a good time. Are you going to the game next week?<br/>One point in three games since the international break.<br/>It seems that I\u2019m not the only team with an injury crisis\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t in great form right now and tbh we were unlucky to miss out on boro with the cancellation when they were really struggling, maybe they still are somewhat, so about time we get some when they\u2019re not fully at it.<br/>Either way tough game but we\u2019ve shown some class and go there in full confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had 8/9 players out most of this season too\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird this.
