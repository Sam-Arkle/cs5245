Potential things to scrape
Who won (result)
goals scored
attendance
number of cards
number of fouls
number of tackles
amount of extra time
should probably do the above on a by team basis
possession?


==============================================

Selenium scraping through fbref:
Can go from 'master' page https://fbref.com/en/squads/1df6b87e/Sheffield-United-Stats
go down the relevant table and pick up who was played, attendance, result, date, whether match was home/away, possession stats,
Need to go into the match report and scrape yellow cards per side, fouls and tackles
Certain stats should look for and if not found report as zero (attendance, fouls, cards...)

Home or away is important as it will make it easier to determine what the attendance is as a percentage of the max value.
